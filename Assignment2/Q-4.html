    <h2>Canvas and SVG tags</h2>
    <h3>Answer:</h3>
    <p>
        Canvas:

        The HTML canvas element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.

            The canvas element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
            
            Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

        SVG:

        SVG defines vector-based graphics in XML format. 
        
        
        SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.
        SVG is used to define graphics for the Web.
        SVG is a W3C recommendation.
